# LASSO and Related Tools for High-Dimensional Vector Autoregression

## Maintained by: Jesper Riis-Vestergaard Sørensen
This project contains an R implementation of LASSO (and variations thereof) with
a data-driven and theoretically justifiable tuning parameter selection method
designed for high-dimensional (HD) vector autoregression (VAR).

The code in this project is used in the paper "Data-Driven Tuning Parameter
Selection for High-Dimensional Vector Autoregressions" by Anders Bredahl Kock,
Rasmus Søndergaard Pedersen and Jesper Riis-Vestergaard Sørensen available at
https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06657. See the paper for the theoretical
justification of the method.

## Installation (TODO)
To install the hd-var R package directly from github, run the following in R:
install_github(repo="jesperrvs/hd-var", subdir="TODO")
